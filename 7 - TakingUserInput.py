#input function is used to take userInput. By default the userInput is considered as a String. Atyant simple.
#In Python, we can take a user input directly by using input() function. This input() function gives a return value as a string/character.
#So, in order to take any other input, we have to pass that into a variable.

#take input and print
a = input()
print(a)
#take input of String and print string
b = input("My name is: ")
print("My name is", b)
#take input of numbers and print as String and INT
x = input("Enter first number: ")
y = input("Enter second number: ")
print(x+y)
print(int(x)+int(y))
